## Game

Echo Jumper is a web game created with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/). Take control of boxes with random abilities, but only one at a time. Record your movements and replay it on loop to create your own platformer to reach the star.

## Music

The background track is a simpler take on my orginal composition called "The Moon".

## Origin

Echo Jumper was created for the [GitHub Game Off 2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023).
